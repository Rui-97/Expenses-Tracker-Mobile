#### Expo Link

Due to the dependency conflicts in Snack Expo, I have opted to use EAS Update/build to publish a build link.

Have Expo Go installed in your device, open the link: https://expo.dev/%40rui1234/ExpenseTracker?serviceType=eas&distribution=expo-go&scheme=&channel=main&sdkVersion=49.0.0 and scan the QR code to access the app.
